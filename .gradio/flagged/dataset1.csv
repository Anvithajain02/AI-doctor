Can you tell me what I'm having?","With what you've described, I think you might be experiencing a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. I would recommend consulting a dermatologist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, but based on your description, it could be due to an allergic reaction, eczema, or a minor burn. In the meantime, I would suggest keeping the area clean and applying a topical cream or ointment to help soothe the skin. If the symptoms persist or worsen, it's best to seek medical attention as soon as possible.",,2025-04-03 20:07:19.072394
